# TOP-Rock-Paper_Scissors
A basic rock paper scissors inspired game

It's a basic game which permitted me to revisit conditionals and taught me to randomize a certain event.
It permitted me to familiarize myself with the console log and the procedure of debugging a code.

/*The improved version*/

I created an actual functional page where we can directly make our choice with buttons and get a live updated score.

This assignment permitted me to have another pov on scope and event listeners.
I tried to break my code in multiple blocks which will make easier the debugging and the readability.
My personal difficulty were to overlay a message on top of the actual game for the restarting. Big up to https://github.com/michalosman whose code greatly inspired me.
